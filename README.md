    ## Description
The Best Reads project is focused around the people who are looking for the books via the Internet. The project aims to help people making crowdsource-based decisions about their next good read and attempts to help the owner making a few bucks. Therefore, it takes shape of a database backed website that not only allows the users to search, rate, recommend and review books, but also enables the site owner to participate in the Amazonâ€™s affiliate program.
