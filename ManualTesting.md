## Search form.
The search form is displayed in the middle of the index page and is available at the top of the other pages. The form, if submitted empty, returns all the books from the database. If a search term and a genre are provided the form returns all the relevant search results. If a book title does not exist within the chosen genre or does not exist in the database at all, the feedback is displayed, as shown in Figure 2.

## Search result page.

In order to fit the search result container, each book description is reduced to 300 characters and the "read more" link is displayed. If available, the link to Amazon and the author's name are displayed, as shown in Figure 3.

The Rating Chart iframe displays a pie chart and a bar chart. Once the rating is submitted in the "Rate" iframe the two charts are updated. The lengths of the rating chart bars are properly aligned in relation to the longest bar and a correct average rating value is calculated, as shown in Figure 9. However, the charts are not always updated immediately and the page needs to be restarted in order to see the results, see [Bugs](https://github.com/andriusci/book-review-project/blob/master/README.md#bugs) section.
